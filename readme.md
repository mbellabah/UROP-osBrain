# Some Notes 

Nice thing is that we can construct an equation for how long it would take for a given number of iterations 

total_time (ms) = 72*x 

Where x is the iteration number and the total tile is given in milliseconds. 

This tells us that the PAC algorithm and this particular implementation are linear in the number of rounds/iterations
